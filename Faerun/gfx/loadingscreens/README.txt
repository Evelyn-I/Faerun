load_0 is the loading screen at startup (the splash screen)
The first loading screen loaded after the splash screen is the image with the highest file name (load_18 loads first after Jade Dragon)
We need the same amount of loading screens as vanilla (18 after JD) or we receive vanilla loading screens
Do not change a loading screen's image or integer unless you know what you're doing!
If you want to add an image that doesn't belong to WotC, make sure you ask permission so you aren't stealing anyone's work
So far, all images are, to the best of my knowledge are properties of WotC
