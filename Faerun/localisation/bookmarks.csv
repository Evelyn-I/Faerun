###BM_FATE_OF_ENGLAND_DESC;A fantasy world setting, described as a world of strange lands, dangerous creatures, and mighty deities, where magic and supernatural phenomena are quite real. Unlike Earth, the lands of the Forgotten Realms are not all ruled by the human race: the planet Toril is shared by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, orcs, and other peoples and creatures. Technologically, the world of the Forgotten Realms is not nearly as advanced as that of Earth; in this respect, it resembles the pre-industrial Earth of the 13th or 14th century. However, the presence of magic provides an additional element of power to the societies. There are several nation states and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for defense or conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_FAERUN_THE_HORDE;The Horde;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FAERUN_THE_HORDE_DESC;For over a thousand years the Hordelands have been a land of tough but disorganized nomads, eternally fighting each other. This all changed when the Khan of the Hoekun tribe started to subjugate, through both force and diplomacy, the other tribes of that desolate land. Now calling himself Yamun Khahan of the Tuigan Horde, he turns westwards and is poised to sweep into Faerun. In face of this threat, Azoun IV of Cormyr has called a Crusade against the Tuigans, though he may have to secure the aid of some old enemies...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_YAMUN;Yamun Khahan;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_37001;Ascending to the position of Khan of the Hoekun after killing his own father, Yamun then did what all "civilized" folk thought unthinkable: he unified the warring nomadic tribes of the Endless Wastes and turned them into a single entity: the Tuigan Horde. Now, he seeks to expand his dominion westwards into Faer˚n.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_AZOUN;Azoun IV Obarskyr;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_20081;Azoun IV was both king of Cormyr and a member of the Purple Dragon Knights. He was both a good administrator and a valiant warrior, refusing to shy away from battle though he had a notable distate for adventuring. When Yamun Khahan turned his Horde westwards, he rallied the various forces of Faer˚n in order to push the nomads back into the Hordelands.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_ABU_BAKR;Abu Bakr;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_38001;Caliph Abu Bakr of Semphar was known as a patron to places of learning, financing many colleges. He was also known for his devoutness to his faith, making large donations to temples and persecuting members of other religions, in particular the faithful of Ilmater who he feared would rally the oppressed commoners against him. Semphar has time and again been subjugated by foreign powers, and now Abu Bakr has had to bend his knee to the Tuigan Khahan.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_GARBO;Tsenya Garbo;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_39001;The ancient Tsenya Garbo is the Lama of Ra-Khati, a successor state of the ancient Imaskari Empire. He was a good-hearted and fearless man who placed Ra-Khati's safety above all else. This has led to him to pay tribute to Yamun Khan so that the Tuigans would turn their attention elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_SZASS;Szass Tam;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_53001;Szass Tam is the Thayan Zulkir of Necromancy and one of the rulers of Thay. Through magic, the lich conceals his true nature, appearing to be mostly alive. He was calm, polite and cultured, though also blunt and despised those who willingly defied him. Like most Zulkirs, he was content to work unseen from the shadows and weave plots both against his fellow Zulkirs and opponents abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_NAME_HYARMON;Hyarmon;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_65201;Hyarmon Huzzilthar is the elderly Iron Lord of Rashemen. Though usually threatened mostly by Thay, Rashemen has suffered against the Tuigan Horde, losing most of its holdings beyond the mountains. Though old, Hyarmons is still a mighty barbarian, respected by his peers and toleranted by the enigmatic Hathrans, the true rulers of Rashemen.;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_FAERUN_DRAGONSPEAR_2;Second Dragonspear War;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FAERUN_DRAGONSPEAR_2_DESC;For the second time in recent history, an army of devils has emerged from the portal to Avernus deep within the ruins of Castle Dragonspear. Immediately, the fiends dominated the local savage humanoids and razed all habitation in the Trade Way. Now the baatezu led by Baazka move against Daggerford, and after, should they succeed, the rest of the Sword Coast.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_NASHER;Lord Nasher Alagondar;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15001;Nashar was the fearless former adventurer and ruler of Neverwinter who held his city firmly. He was also the "founder" of the Alagondar royal family. Brave in the face of his enemies but affable when among his people, Nasher was noted for his steadfast opposition against Luskan and the orcs of the North. He had a great love of music and hearing tales of faraway lands.;;;;;;;;;;;x
